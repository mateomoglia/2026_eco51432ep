    "text": "Plots with ggplot2\n\nGeneral description\nThis package is a workhorse of data visualization in R. The structure is somewhat similar to the dplyr approach. The idea is to apply to a ggplot() object a series of functions to add elements to the plot and control the appearance of the latter. The syntax requires:\n\nData, from which the graph will be made\nMapping, a set of instructions to “structure” the appearance of the graphs. Usually, it sets the axes, the grouping variables, among other things. It is also referred as aesthetics\nLayers, which converts the data and the mapping into geometries (points, lines, regression lines, bar charts, etc.)\n[opt.] Scales, to control the appearance of the mapping (axes length, colors, etc.)\n[opt.] Guides/Themes, to control the general appearance of the graph\n\nUsually, the ggplot function takes two main arguments and one to many sub-arguments. The two main arguments are (i) the data on which the visualization is required and (ii) an aesthetic. The aesthetic controls the key element of the visualization, such as the x and y axes or the grouping colors/linetypes.\nLet’s imagine we have a dataset df with x_val and y_val values and a grouping variable (gender, country, etc.). Hence, to plot a scatter plot, we would code:\n\nggplot(df, mapping = aes(x = x_val, y = y_val, colour = gender)) + # Set the graph\n    geom_point() + # Add points\n    theme_void() # Control the general appearance of the graph\n\n\n\nMore details",

Here are some common formats:\n\n\n\nExtension\nFormat\nDescription\nEfficiency ⭐\n\n\n\n\n.csv\nCSV\nComma-separated values\n⭐⭐\n\n\n.tsv\nTSV\nTab-separated values\n⭐⭐\n\n\n.xlsx\nXLSX\nExcel spreadsheet\n⭐\n\n\n.RData\nRData\nR’s format\n⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n.json\nJSON\nJavaScript\n⭐⭐\n\n\n.parquet\nPARQUET\nColumnar storage\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n.sql\nSQL\nStructured database storage\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n\nMany other formats exist, depending on the source or the type of data stored (eg, spatial data).\n\n\nOpen data in R\nWe are going to manipulate mostly .csv database. There are non-proprietary and can be opened by virtually all softwares. This is not the most efficient way to store data. If you manipulate very large database (tens of millions of observations with hundreds of columns), I advise you to use .parquet.\nBase R includes a function to open .csv files with the function read.csv2(). Some packages might be required to open other formats. To open large .csv dataset, I advise you to use the fread() function from the package data.table.\nThe syntax is:\n\ndata = read.csv2(path = \"C:/your/path/data_to_open.csv\")\n\n\n\nWrite data\nOnce you are done cleaning the data, you might want to save your dataset (this is actually good practice!). Most functions to read data, have a writing function counterpart. Hence:\n\nwrite.csv2(data, path = \"C:/your/path/name_of_the_dataset.csv\")\n\n\n\nUse a paste()\nYou might want to save a bit of time, reduce the probability of writing errors, and increase the reliability and reproducibility of your code by using a path object within a paste() function. This function, from base R, simply concatenates two strings. For instance paste(\"Hello\",\"world\",sep = \" \") will produce \"Hello world\". An alternative function is paste0() which, by default, concatenates without space. Hence, paste(\"Hello\",\"world\",sep = \"\") and paste0(\"Hello\",\"world\") would be stricly equivalent and prints Helloword.\nIt comes handy with the read.csv2() and the write.csv2() functions. Instead of rewriting the total length each time, you can call the path object you created earlier on. If the dataset idf_data.csv is stored in the subfolder /data, it is easy to open it:\n\npath = \"/Users/mateomoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2026_eco51432ep\"\n\ndata = read.csv2(path = paste0(path,\"/data/idf_data.csv\"))\n\nIt is useful if you share code with someone. You need to change only the line with the path, instead of the whole code.\n\n\nDiscover the data\nI prepared a dataset, mainly drawn from INSEE data, and downloaded from the Institut Paris Region, a research organization on urbanism in the Ile-de-France region. It contains various socio-economic variables at the municipality (and Paris’ arrondissement) level. It contains information on demographic characteristics, income, and on housing market variables.\nThe codebook contains all variables and a quick description.",

    "text": "Data cleaning\nData cleaning refers to going from a raw dataset to a dataset than can be used and manipulated efortlessly. Below, here are some examples of data cleaning procedures:\n\nFormat column names (eg, replace spaces with underscores with function rename());\nRemove missing values if they are real missing values with mutate() and ifelse();\nReplace weird values by NAs or 0s (eg, most INSEE missing wage values are 99999 and should be refered as NAs, and not as 99999) with mutate() and ifelse();\nClean/create ID variables (for instance, municipal ID in France is made of the département code in 2-digit and the municipality in 3-digit. To create a municipal ID, one needs to concatenate both) with mutate() and paste0();\nPut variables in the right format (eg, numeric variables such as wage should be… numeric and not string – super frequent with .csv datasets that do not store the column format) with mutate() and as.numeric() or as.character();\nOverall visual inspection (check if no weird values, use the summary() or head() functions)\n\nAlthough time consuming, this step is particularly important to (i) familiarize with the data and (ii) save precious time when it comes to the data analysis.\nUsually, data come from a codebook, a dictionnary, or some kind of documentation (another dataset or a .pdf). It is super useful to read them carefully to understand how data are reported (missing values, column names, variable formatting) .\nFor the purpose of the class, data are already cleaned but never take data as face value!",

    "text": "Data manipulation\n\nMerge datasets\nIn real world situation, data come from many sources and/or are delivered in many datasets (one per year, or per area, for instance). Then, you want to merge them to obtain a bigger and more insightful datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause R is an objet-based language, you can manipulate several datasets within the same function. However, this is perilous as you have to make sure that they have the same dimensions, are formated the same, etc. Merging reduces the probability to face those issues\n\n\nIn dplyr, the merging is done through the joint functions. A join between a df1 and a df2 has to be done on at least one joining variable. There are several types of joints:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninner_join()\nReturns rows with matching keys in both tables\n\n\nleft_join()\nReturns all rows from the left table, with matches from the right if present\n\n\nright_join()\nReturns all rows from the right table, with matches from the left if present\n\n\nfull_join()\nReturns all rows from both tables, matching where possible\n\n\nsemi_join()\nReturns rows from the left table that have a match in the right table\n\n\nanti_join()\nReturns rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right table\n\n\n\nHence, the code should look like that:\n\nmerged_df = left_join(df1, df2)\n\nIf they do not share a common variable, an approach is to use the option by = c(df1$x, df2$y):\n\nmerged_df = left_join(df1, df2, by = c(df1$x,df2$y))\n\nOf course, this is compatible with the pipe syntax:\n\nmerged_df = df1 %&gt;%\n  left_join(df2)\n\n\n\nReshape datasets\nData manipulation also goes with reshaping the datasets. Let’s say a dataset contains the population at the municipal level. The first column is the municipality ID and each other column in the population for a given year, such that: codgeo, pop1999, pop2000, until pop2023.\nTo obtain a panel dataset (multiple IDs observed multiple times), we need to reshape the datasets in long format (as opposed to wide). The function is pivot_longer(). This function is from the library tidyr. You need to download it first and load it.\n\ndata_long = data_wide %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"pop\"), # Might have used -codgeo\n    names_to = \"year\",         # New col name\n    values_to = \"population\",  # New col name\n    names_prefix = \"pop\"       # Remove the prefix \n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) # Not necessary, but usually year is numeric\n\nThe counterpart function is tidyr::pivot_wider().\n\n\nOther manipulations\nIn dplyr, it is possible to manipulate data using the following functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfilter()\nSelects rows based on logical conditions (eg, keep Ile de France)\n\n\nselect()\nChooses columns by name\n\n\narrange()\nReorders rows based on column values\n\n\ndistinct()\nReturns unique rows\n\n\nslice()\nSelects rows by position or helper functions (e.g., slice_head())\n\n\nbind_rows()\nStack two dataframes by rows\n\n\nbind_cols()\nCombine two dataframes side by side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nOpen the population dataset /raw/idf_pop.csv and check if is clean\nCreate a subset containing only codgeo and the columns that start with popmun\nMake it long with codgeo as the ID and a year column\nExtract the most recent year (ideally, using a function)\nOpen the housing cost dataset raw/idf_rents.csv\nCreate a dataset with 3 columns: codgeo, loy_sqm_appartment and loy_sqm_house\nMerge the population datasets (population in the most recent year and the population by CSP) and the housing cost datasets on municipality ID\nSave the newly merged dataset in .csv in an appropriate subfolder.\n\nThis latter dataset will be our main dataset for the rest of the class.",

Knowing those practices is relevant for several reasons:\n\nSave yourself time in the future: it might me bothersome at first, but the future you will thank the current you\nResearch reproducibility is a high-stake aspect of research\nIT is probably more pleasant to work in a tidy and clean environment than in a messy one\n\n\nFolder organization\nComputers are organized around folders. We are going to work in a working directory (wd), but we need to identify it. My folder tree looks like it:\n/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/\n├── Documents/\n│   ├── perso/\n│   │   ├── banque/\n│   │   ├── admin/\n│   │   └── festival/\n├── Downloads/\n├── Music/\n├── Pictures/\n│   ├── famille/\n│   ├── vacances/\n└── courses/\n│   ├── polytechnique/\n|   |   ├── 2024_eco102/\n|   |   ├── 2025_eco1s002/\n|   |   ├── 2026_eco51423ep/\n├── research/\nHere we are going to work in ~/courses/2026_eco51423ep/. This folder may (and should!) contains subfolders, for instance: /code, /output, /raw_data, etc. Each time I start a project, I always create those ones – with a similar naming conventions in all my projects. I stick to these rules to save time when navigating between projects (and when changing computers).\n\n\nNaming convention\nA typical tip is to choose simple and short titles for the files and the scripts. For instance, this file is named part0_r.qmd. Your code can be named code_tutorial.R. It should be self-explanatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid at all cost to use spaces or special characters in your file names. Prefer instead an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing code\n\nAlways comment your code, make it readable for your future self but also for others. You may use your code in a week, a month, a year, and should be able to directly understands it! Comments in R starts with #.\nWhen creating objects, functions, or whatever, give it simple but understandable names.\nFor instance, if you create a data frame containing wages for individuals aged between 25 and 30, you way call it wage_25_30 and not w2530 (too short) or wage_individuals_aged_25_30 (too long).\nMoreover, especially for large project, you want to have different scripts. Always keep scripts short and with clear names. For instance 1_clean_data.R, 2_import_wages.R, 3_merge_datasets.R, and 4_data_analysis.R."

R has built-in functions but most useful functions should be called using library().\nThese libraries should be first downloaded then loaded into your project.\nFirst, open RStudio and opens a new script.\nYou should have an empty page. You may want to write some words at the top of it to have an idea of what this code does.

As we just check, data is a data.frame object. It is made of several columns and rows.\nTo call a specific column in a dataframe, we use the $ operator. To know all the column names in data, we can use the function names(). To know the “size” of the dataframe, the right function is dim(): the first element is the number of rows and the second the number of columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also call a column by its position in the dataframe. For instance, to call the second column you can type data[,2]. For the second row: data[,2]. What should you write to print the 10th element of the 3rd column?\n\n\nTo describe the data, we can use several built-in functions.\n\ntable(data$Species) # To make a frequency table\n\n\n    setosa versicolor  virginica \n        50         50         50 \n\nsummary(data$Sepal.Length) # To provide summary statistics\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

It takes at least one argument, on the x axis. Here, with two arguments, it plots a simple scatter plot.\n\nplot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width)"

    "text": "The tidyverse\n\nWhy and how use it?\nThere are several ways to code in R. The first one, as we just saw, is called “base R”. Although useful to perform very simple task, it becomes inefficient for more difficult tasks. The most popular approach in the R community is by far the tidyverse approach. The idea is simple: we are going to apply a series of functions on an object to modify it or create a new object.\nIts popularity arises from two important factors: it is simple and straightforward to understand and it is faster than base R. A third approach is data.table. It is the fastest approach but requires a high entry cost and is not straightforward.\nTo use it, we can download the package dplyr and load it into our session. You need to download the package once (as long as you keep the same computer) but to load it each time you open RStudio. This is true for all packages. Note that all the function from the base package are natively loaded into R.\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\") # Notice the quotation marks\nlibrary(dplyr) # Notice the absence of quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost of time, a function exists only in one package. However, it occurs that two packages load functions with the same name. To make sure you use the function from the desired package, you can use the package::function() syntax. In my research, I usually have to deal with that with the function select() that is loaded in dplyr and in sf (a package for spatial data manipulation).

It is supported by a lively and active user community. R is an object-based language, meaning that we are going to manipulate objects through a series of commands.\nR can be used directly from a command terminal, but we prefer to use RStudio, an IDE, to make our lifes easier. An IDE is an interface that eases the use of a software. The most popular one is RStudio. To use it, we need to:\n\nDownload R\nThen, download RStudio\n\n\nYou can download both from here https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/."

    "text": "General best practices\nBefore jumping to coding per se, let me recall you some best practices when performing computer-based tasks. Knowing those practices is relevant for several reasons:\n\nSave yourself time in the future: it might me bothersome at first, but the future you will thank the current you\nResearch reproducibility is a high-stake aspect of research\nIT is probably more pleasant to work in a tidy and clean environment than in a messy one\n\n\nFolder organization\nComputers are organized around folders. We are going to work in a working directory (wd), but we need to identify it. My folder tree looks like it:\n/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/\n├── Documents/\n│   ├── perso/\n│   │   ├── banque/\n│   │   ├── admin/\n│   │   └── festival/\n├── Downloads/\n├── Music/\n├── Pictures/\n│   ├── famille/\n│   ├── vacances/\n└── courses/\n│   ├── polytechnique/\n|   |   ├── 2024_eco102/\n|   |   ├── 2025_eco1s002/\n|   |   ├── 2026_eco51423ep/\n├── research/\nHere we are going to work in ~/courses/2026_eco51423ep/. This folder may (and should!) contains subfolders, for instance: /code, /output, /raw_data, etc. Each time I start a project, I always create those ones – with a similar naming conventions in all my projects. I stick to these rules to save time when navigating between projects (and when changing computers).\n\n\nNaming convention\nA typical tip is to choose simple and short titles for the files and the scripts. For instance, this file is named part0_r.qmd. Your code can be named code_tutorial.R. It should be self-explanatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAvoid at all cost to use spaces or special characters in your file names. Prefer instead an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing code\n\nAlways comment your code, make it readable for your future self but also for others. You may use your code in a week, a month, a year, and should be able to directly understands it! Comments in R starts with #.\nWhen creating objects, functions, or whatever, give it simple but understandable names.\nFor instance, if you create a data frame containing wages for individuals aged between 25 and 30, you way call it wage_25_30 and not w2530 (too short) or wage_individuals_aged_25_30 (too long).\nMoreover, especially for large project, you want to have different scripts. Always keep scripts short and with clear names. For instance 1_clean_data.R, 2_import_wages.R, 3_merge_datasets.R, and 4_data_analysis.R."

Hence, we need to load them thanks to packages.\n\n\n\nOpen a script\n\nWe are going to create our first script (the extension is .R).\nThis script contains all commands you want to run. R has built-in functions but most useful functions should be called using library().\nThese libraries should be first downloaded then loaded into your project.\nFirst, open RStudio and opens a new script.\nYou should have an empty page. You may want to write some words at the top of it to have an idea of what this code does. You can use # to comment code.\n\n\n\nSeek for help and documentation\nTo know more about a function, simply type ?function in the console. Of course, internet is your friend, and ChatGPT (or any other LLMs) are pretty good at R. As I learnt how to use R in the LLM-era, I, of course, prefer to use Stack or other online forums instead!\n\n\nScript\n\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# This script opens a dataset and proceeds\n# to data visualization.\n#\n# Author: Matéo Moglia\n# Date: 12/02/2025\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Set your working directory\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/mateomoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2026_eco51432ep\")\npath &lt;- \"/Users/mateomoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2026_eco51432ep\"\n\nHere, I set the working directory using setwd(). Notice that we created our first object, named path using the assignment operator &lt;- (I personally prefer to use = which works exactly the same). This object will turn out to be useful later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhat is the class of path? Hint: use the function class()\n\n\n\n\nOur first data manipulation\nWe can load a very famous built-in data set, the iris dataset, into an object called data.\n\ndata = iris # Attribute to data the data set iris\nclass(data) # Check its class\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nhead(data) # Preview the first lines of data\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nNotice that the two objects we created so far can be seen in the Environment pane.\n\n\nData description\nBy clicking on the object in the Environement panel, you can visualize it, but you can also write some code to describe it. As we just check, data is a data.frame object. It is made of several columns and rows.\nTo call a specific column in a dataframe, we use the $ operator. To know all the column names in data, we can use the function names(). To know the “size” of the dataframe, the right function is dim(): the first element is the number of rows and the second the number of columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also call a column by its position in the dataframe. For instance, to call the second column you can type data[,2]. For the second row: data[,2]. What should you write to print the 10th element of the 3rd column?\n\n\nTo describe the data, we can use several built-in functions.\n\ntable(data$Species) # To make a frequency table\n\n\n    setosa versicolor  virginica \n        50         50         50 \n\nsummary(data$Sepal.Length) # To provide summary statistics\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  4.300   5.100   5.800   5.843   6.400   7.900 \n\n\nNow, we want to visualize the data. To do so, we can use base R function plot(). It takes at least one argument, on the x axis. Here, with two arguments, it plots a simple scatter plot.\n\nplot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width)"

    "text": "The tidyverse\n\nWhy and how use it?\nThere are several ways to code in R. The first one, as we just saw, is called “base R”. Although useful to perform very simple task, it becomes inefficient for more difficult tasks. The most popular approach in the R community is by far the tidyverse approach. The idea is simple: we are going to apply a series of functions on an object to modify it or create a new object.\nIts popularity arises from two important factors: it is simple and straightforward to understand and it is faster than base R. A third approach is data.table. It is the fastest approach but requires a high entry cost and is not straightforward.\nTo use it, we can download the package dplyr and load it into our session. You need to download the package once (as long as you keep the same computer) but to load it each time you open RStudio. This is true for all packages. Note that all the function from the base package are natively loaded into R.\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\") # Notice the quotation marks\nlibrary(dplyr) # Notice the absence of quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost of time, a function exists only in one package. However, it occurs that two packages load functions with the same name. To make sure you use the function from the desired package, you can use the package::function() syntax. In my research, I usually have to deal with that with the function select() that is loaded in dplyr and in sf (a package for spatial data manipulation). Hence, if both packages are loaded and I want to use the one from dplyr, I have to write dplyr::select().\n\n\n\n\nGeneral philosophy\nEach function are going to be separated by a pipe operator %&gt;%.
